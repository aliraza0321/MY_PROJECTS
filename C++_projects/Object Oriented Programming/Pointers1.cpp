	ptr = &c1; //address of c1 will be stored in ptr
	//Let's try dereferencing the pointer:
		//cout << *ptr << endl; 
	//it will generate an error
	//Reason: The pointer does not know how much memory it will read for the data.
	//if you have pointer to integer like int *p1, In this scenario, p1 exactly knows
	//the size of the memory from which data is read i.e.,(4 bytes). Dereferencing of 
	//void pointers is slightly different. you need to explicitly mention what type of 
	//data void pointer is pointing to. like in this scenario the current status of 
	//void pointer is it is pointing to char. 
	cout << *(char*)ptr;
	// (char*) will provide the information to the compiler that ptr is pointing to char
	// and an additional * before parenthesis is to dereference the memory location where 
	// void pointer is pointing. It will read the data from the memory of 1byte.
	cout << *(double*)ptr << endl; //is it a valid statement?
	//ptr is pointing to char but we are writing *(double *). 
	//Yes it is a valid statement however ptr will read the data from the memory of 8bytes
	//and garbage value will be printed.

	//Pointer to pointer (double pointers)
		int x = 4, y = 20, z = 8;
		int* ptr1 = &x; //ptr is a pointer to integer

		int**p1 = &ptr1;
	//what is p1?
		//p1 is a pointer to ptr
		//put the definition of "ptr" here
		//p1 is a pointer to (pointer to integer)
	//declaration: int**p1 //p1 is a pointer to (pointer to integer)
		//p1 = &y; //is it a valid assignment?
	//No it is not. We are trying to assign the address of an 
	//integer to (pointer to pointer to integer).
		// *p1 = y; //is it a valid assignment
	//No it is not. Since p1 is not a pointer to integer so if we dereference
	//p1 it means we are in the block of pointer where p1 is pointing which is 
	//ptr in this case and the ptr itself is a pointer, can not store an integer.

		*p1 = &y; //is it a valid assignment?
	//Yes it is. by dereferencing p1 we are in the block of pointer where
	//p1 is pointing and it will store the address of int variable y in the
	//block of ptr. Now ptr is pointing to variable y.    

		**p1 = x+5; //double dereferencing. is it possible here and what will be the outcome?
	//Yes it possible in this scenario. You can dereference only pointers. Since p1 is a pointer
	//to pointer to integer so the 1st * will take you the block of ptr i.e.,(where p1 is pointing)
	//and the 2nd * will take you the block of integer variable y i.e.,(where ptr is pointing) and
	//it will store the sum of x and 5 in the memory block of variable y.
		cout << y << " " << *ptr1 << " " << **p1 << endl; //predict the output

		//int **p3 = &p1; is it a valid assignment?
	//No it is not. Why? p1 is already a pointer to pointer to intger (double pointer), you can not 
	//store its address in another double pointer. To make it a valid assignment p3 must be a triple pointer.

		int **p3 = p1; //is it a valid assignment?
	//Yes it is.
	//What is p3? p3 is a pointer to pointer to integer. It means p3 will hold the address of a pointer and that
	//pointer will point to an integer.
	//why this assignment is valid? 
	//p1 is holding the address of pointer and that pointer is pointing to an integer so we can store the data of
	//p1 in the memory block of p3. Now p1 and p3 both are pointing to ptr.

		*p3 = &z;
		x = 50;
		cout << **p1 << " "<< *ptr1 << endl; //predict the output
	//Since p3 and p1 both are pointing to ptr. By dereferencing p3 we are assigning the address of z in the memory 
	//block of ptr so now ptr is pointing to variable z.

	//Postfix increment using pointer.

		int * temp = &x; //temp is pointing to x and value of x is 50
		*temp++;
		cout << x << " " << *temp << endl; //predict the output
	//Precedence of ++ operator is higher than * operator so it will move the pointer to next memory location first 
	//and then dereference that memory location. So value of x will remain unchanged however ptr is no longer pointing to x.
	//To increment the value of x using postfix operator with pointer we need to apply parenthesis around *ptr  
	//	temp = &x; //temp is again pointing to x.
	// do you think we can also use temp-- to relocate the temp to integer variable x? 

		(*temp)++; //dereference the pointer first and then increment the value of the memory block where temp was pointing by 1.
		cout << x << endl;
